        <p>I&rsquo;m sitting at home with a bit of a cold, trying to think over everything that I did and thought last week - and I&rsquo;m having trouble. I&rsquo;m exhausted; exhausted and so happy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me actually summarize this week because it was such a whirlwind. On the train yesterday I ticked of a list of things I did that could be expanded into a whole blog-post:</p>

<ul>
<li>Published three NPM modules</li>
<li>Started to understand binary operations and bitshifting for the first time</li>
<li>Learned some Regex techniques.</li>
<li>Met about 60 new people.</li>
<li>Build a whole bunch of log chips.</li>
<li>Learned how to randomize the order of an array in Javascript.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on like this for a long time, but it didn&rsquo;t really help me decide what to actually write about. And so I asked my Justine about how to write some sort of summary post. Her suggestion was to try to think of the most significant thing I learned.</p>

<p>Looking over that list above I can&rsquo;t help but marvel at what I can get done with focus, support, and some self belief; its the start of a great journey. And its my journey to make.</p>

<p>And <strong>That</strong> is what last week taught me.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t quite figured out how this is happening, but it&rsquo;s magical. It seems that simply spending time at RC with positive people, with shared focus, who don&rsquo;t engage in any kind of judgement about what we (any of us) can or can&rsquo;t do or understand changes how I think. This environment has helped me realized how often I judge myself about what I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> know and what I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do. Usually this comes by way of comparison with someone else. But it never helps me move forward.</p>

<p>Everyone here at RC is just doing <em>their</em> thing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no assumptions about your background or your interests or your path; there&rsquo;s simply support to become a better programmer. And that&rsquo;s powerful. I can see the power of that simple idea as I tick through my <code>Did</code> lists. I&rsquo;m pretty shocked actually, and humbled to be here. I can&rsquo;t wait for the weeks to come.</p>
